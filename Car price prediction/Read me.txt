Objective: Predicting car prices
Goal:
•	Performed the Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the relationships and produce the inferential statistical results for feature selection.
•	Built a data pipeline, trained regression models and identfied the best regression model 

Tasks performed: 
1. iported the data and checked for the basics insigths
	a. Data types
	b. Statistical Summery (Using 'describe()' method)
2.Pre-processed the data: 
	a. Identified and handles the missing data
	b.Checked and corrected the data formats
	c. Performed feature scaling
	d. Normalizied necessary columns
	e.Binned numerical data
	f. Converted categorical data
	g. saved the pre-processed data
3. Performed "Exploratoty Data Analysis":
	a. Checked the data types
	b. Distiguished the data based on theri types
	c. Performed visual data analysis
	d. Performed statiscal data analysis
	e. Identified highly correlated columns
4. Developed and identified the best model:
	a. Got the data ready/ Performed post processing
	b. Splitted the data into training and test sets
	c. Created pipelines: 
		# for Linear regression for multiple variables
		# for Polynomial regression
	d. Performed model evaluation
		# using error measures
		# cross_val_score
		#using visual techniques
	e. Made a final decision:
		# Identified the best model based on the evaluation scores
